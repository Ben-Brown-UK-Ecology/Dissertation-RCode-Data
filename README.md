# Dissertation-RCode-Data

Hello!
This repository contains all the data I recorded from the analysed sonograms as well as the code I used to analyse it and create the graphs for my paper.
Dissertation.R was the file I used to test code and alter it to produce the results I wanted.
Dissertation.R part 2 was the file I used to analyse difference in change in echolocation rate.
Dissertation Frequency Analysis.R was the file I used to analyse the difference in change in echolocation frequency.

All code prompts given by ChatGPT were used and edited to fit my code.
